This is a basic gaming project build on the foundation of **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**(beginner level project).
This project is part of my JavaScript learning course, I am very much grateful to [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/) for his style of teaching, you can also avail the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).

I have implemented his idea but modified the code to different level(soon you will find out).
