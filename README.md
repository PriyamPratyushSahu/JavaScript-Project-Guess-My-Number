# Guess My Number

Hello Everyone ðŸ˜Š

This is a basic gaming project build on the foundation of **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**(beginner level project).
This project is part of my JavaScript learning course, I am very much grateful to [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/) for his style of teaching, you can also avail the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).

I have implemented his idea but modified the code to different level(soon you will find out).

A random number gets generated between 1 to 20, the user has to enter a number between 1 to 20. The score is set to 20 in the beginning, after each attempt the score reduces by 1, if the user loses all his 20 attempts then he lost the game

or the user guess the correct random number.
