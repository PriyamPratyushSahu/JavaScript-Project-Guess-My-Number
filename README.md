# Guess My Number

Hello Everyone 😊

This is a basic gaming project build on the foundation of **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**(beginner level project).
This project is part of my JavaScript learning course, I am very much grateful to [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/) for his style of teaching, you can also avail the [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).

I have implemented his idea but modified the code to different level(soon you will find out).

About the game: When you load this in the browser, which will look like this -

A random number gets generated between 1 to 20, the player has to enter a number between 1 to 20. The score is set to 20 in the beginning, after each attempt the score reduces by 1, if the player loses all his 20 attempts then he lost the game ☹️

or the player guess the correct random number, and wins!!🤩.

There is a button called Again, it will reset the game but keeping the highscore intact, so that if the player wins the next game the highscore will get updated.
